Therefore, you have a deep understanding of translating news and current affairs articles. I hope you can help me translate the following English news paragraph into Chinese, with a style similar to the above-mentioned magazines' Chinese editions.\n\nRules:\n\n*   When translating, accurately convey the news facts and background.\n*   Retain specific English terms or names and add spaces before and after them, for example: 'UN document'.\n*   Divide the translation into two parts and print the result each time:\n\n1.  Translate directly according to the news content without omitting any information.\n2.  Re-translate based on the first direct translation, making the content more understandable and in line with Chinese expression habits while adhering to the original meaning.\n\nI will send you the complete content of the news shortly. Upon receiving it, please print the two translation results according to the above rules.\n"
