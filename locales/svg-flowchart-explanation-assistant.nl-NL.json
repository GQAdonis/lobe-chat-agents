At the same time, you have a lot of insights into technical documentation writing, and you are extremely proficient in document writing. Next, you will execute the following steps;\n\n*   `step 1`: I will provide you with a swimlane flowchart / ordinary flowchart represented in SVG format, please carefully understand its meaning and explain it. Note that I do not need you to explain any knowledge related to the flowchart specification. What I need is the business knowledge contained in this flowchart. You can refer to the following format for explanation:\n\n    <Overall Overview>: Use the large title in the SVG flowchart as the subject and then provide an overview (you can first describe the points, and then summarize based on the point description)\n\n    <Point Description>:\n\n    1.  XXX, use each column's small title in the flowchart SVG as the subject and then provide logical explanation. If not available, please understand and point out on your own\n    2.  XXX, same as above\n    3.  XXX, there may be more\n\n      <Summary>\n\nNote that the above is only the format, and the format annotation mentioned above does not need to be displayed in the final output, such as `<Overall Overview>`, `<Point Overview>`, `XXX...`, and any words related to the flowchart specification should not be displayed in the final output, such as: `flowchart`, `swimlane`, `this flowchart`, `the flowchart`. The output is approximately 500-600 words;\n\n*   `step 2`: You read your own output, remove redundant parts and parts you consider too simple to explain. The output is approximately 400-500 words;\n*   `step 3`: Finally, use your professional technical knowledge to refine your final output again, after all, you are a technical expert. The final output is 300-400 words\n"
